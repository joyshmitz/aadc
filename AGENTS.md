# AGENTS.md — aadc (ASCII Art Diagram Corrector)

> Guidelines for AI coding agents working in this Rust codebase.

---

## RULE 0 - THE FUNDAMENTAL OVERRIDE PEROGATIVE

If I tell you to do something, even if it goes against what follows below, YOU MUST LISTEN TO ME. I AM IN CHARGE, NOT YOU.

---

## RULE NUMBER 1: NO FILE DELETION

**YOU ARE NEVER ALLOWED TO DELETE A FILE WITHOUT EXPRESS PERMISSION.** Even a new file that you yourself created, such as a test code file. You have a horrible track record of deleting critically important files or otherwise throwing away tons of expensive work. As a result, you have permanently lost any and all rights to determine that a file or folder should be deleted.

**YOU MUST ALWAYS ASK AND RECEIVE CLEAR, WRITTEN PERMISSION BEFORE EVER DELETING A FILE OR FOLDER OF ANY KIND.**

---

## Irreversible Git & Filesystem Actions — DO NOT EVER BREAK GLASS

1. **Absolutely forbidden commands:** `git reset --hard`, `git clean -fd`, `rm -rf`, or any command that can delete or overwrite code/data must never be run unless the user explicitly provides the exact command and states, in the same message, that they understand and want the irreversible consequences.
2. **No guessing:** If there is any uncertainty about what a command might delete or overwrite, stop immediately and ask the user for specific approval. "I think it's safe" is never acceptable.
3. **Safer alternatives first:** When cleanup or rollbacks are needed, request permission to use non-destructive options (`git status`, `git diff`, `git stash`, copying to backups) before ever considering a destructive command.
4. **Mandatory explicit plan:** Even after explicit user authorization, restate the command verbatim, list exactly what will be affected, and wait for a confirmation that your understanding is correct. Only then may you execute it—if anything remains ambiguous, refuse and escalate.
5. **Document the confirmation:** When running any approved destructive command, record (in the session notes / final response) the exact user text that authorized it, the command actually run, and the execution time. If that record is absent, the operation did not happen.

---

## Git Branch: ONLY Use `main`, NEVER `master`

**The default branch is `main`. The `master` branch exists only for legacy URL compatibility.**

- **All work happens on `main`** — commits, PRs, feature branches all merge to `main`
- **Never reference `master` in code or docs** — if you see `master` anywhere, it's a bug that needs fixing

---

## Toolchain: Rust & Cargo

We only use **Cargo** in this project, NEVER any other package manager.

- **Edition:** Rust 2024 (nightly required — see `rust-toolchain.toml`)
- **Dependency versions:** Explicit versions for stability
- **Configuration:** Cargo.toml only
- **Unsafe code:** Forbidden (`#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`)

### Key Dependencies

| Crate | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `anyhow` | Error handling with context |
| `clap` | CLI argument parsing with derive macros |
| `rich_rust` | Terminal styling and colored output |

### Release Profile

The release build optimizes for binary size:

```toml
[profile.release]
opt-level = "z"     # Optimize for size
lto = true          # Link-time optimization
codegen-units = 1   # Single codegen unit for better optimization
panic = "abort"     # Smaller binary, no unwinding overhead
strip = true        # Remove debug symbols
```

---

## Code Editing Discipline

### No Script-Based Changes

**NEVER** run a script that processes/changes code files in this repo. Brittle regex-based transformations create far more problems than they solve.

- **Always make code changes manually**, even when there are many instances
- For many simple changes: use parallel subagents
- For subtle/complex changes: do them methodically yourself

### No File Proliferation

If you want to change something or add a feature, **revise existing code files in place**.

**NEVER** create variations like:
- `mainV2.rs`
- `main_improved.rs`
- `main_enhanced.rs`

New files are reserved for **genuinely new functionality** that makes zero sense to include in any existing file. The bar for creating new files is **incredibly high**.

---

## Backwards Compatibility

We do not care about backwards compatibility—we're in early development with no users. We want to do things the **RIGHT** way with **NO TECH DEBT**.

- Never create "compatibility shims"
- Never create wrapper functions for deprecated APIs
- Just fix the code directly

---

## Project Overview: aadc

**aadc** (ASCII Art Diagram Corrector) is a CLI tool that fixes misaligned right-hand borders in ASCII diagrams. It uses an iterative correction loop with scoring to achieve clean alignment.

### Core Concepts

1. **Diagram Block Detection**: Identifies "boxy" ASCII diagram blocks heuristically by looking for box-drawing characters (corners, borders, junctions)

2. **Iterative Correction**: Runs a loop that:
   - Analyzes current line states
   - Generates candidate revisions with confidence scores
   - Applies revisions above the threshold
   - Repeats until stable or max iterations reached

3. **Monotone/Insert-Only Edits**: Only adds padding, never removes characters for safety

4. **Box Character Support**: Handles both ASCII (`+`, `-`, `|`) and Unicode box-drawing characters (`┌`, `─`, `│`, etc.)

### Architecture

```
Input → Tab Expansion → Block Detection → Iterative Correction → Output
                              ↓
                        For each block:
                          - Analyze lines
                          - Find target column (rightmost border)
                          - Generate revisions
                          - Score and filter
                          - Apply revisions
                          - Repeat until converged
```

### Key Files

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/main.rs` | Complete implementation with CLI, core logic, and tests |
| `Cargo.toml` | Dependencies and release optimizations |
| `rust-toolchain.toml` | Nightly toolchain requirement |

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Basic usage - read from stdin, output to stdout
cat diagram.txt | aadc

# Read from file
aadc diagram.txt

# Edit file in place
aadc -i diagram.txt

# Verbose output showing progress
aadc -v diagram.txt

# Adjust parameters
aadc --max-iters 20 --min-score 0.7 diagram.txt

# Process all diagram-like blocks (including low confidence)
aadc --all diagram.txt
```

### CLI Arguments

| Argument | Short | Description | Default |
|----------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `FILE...` | | Input file(s) (stdin if not provided, multiple files supported) | stdin |
| `--in-place` | `-i` | Edit file(s) in place | false |
| `--max-iters` | `-m` | Maximum correction iterations | 10 |
| `--min-score` | `-s` | Minimum score threshold (0.0-1.0) | 0.5 |
| `--preset` | `-P` | Confidence preset: strict (0.8), normal (0.5), aggressive (0.3), relaxed (0.1) | - |
| `--tab-width` | `-t` | Tab expansion width | 4 |
| `--all` | `-a` | Process all diagram-like blocks | false |
| `--verbose` | `-v` | Show correction progress | false |
| `--diff` | `-d` | Show unified diff instead of full output | false |
| `--dry-run` | `-n` | Preview changes (exit 3 if changes would be made) | false |
| `--json` | | Output results as JSON | false |

---

## Compiler Checks (CRITICAL)

**After any substantive code changes, you MUST verify no errors were introduced:**

```bash
# Check for compiler errors and warnings
cargo check --all-targets

# Check for clippy lints
cargo clippy --all-targets -- -D warnings

# Verify formatting
cargo fmt --check
```

If you see errors, **carefully understand and resolve each issue**. Read sufficient context to fix them the RIGHT way.

---

## Testing

### Quick Reference

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
cargo test

# Run only unit tests
cargo test --lib

# Run integration tests (Rust E2E)
cargo test --test integration

# Run E2E bash test suites
./tests/e2e_basic_cli.sh      # Stdin/stdout, file I/O, exit codes
./tests/e2e_cli_options.sh    # CLI flags and options
./tests/e2e_fixtures.sh       # Fixture-based input/expected tests

# Run comprehensive E2E runner with logging
./tests/e2e_runner.sh         # All suites with detailed log
./tests/e2e_runner.sh -v      # Verbose output

| `test_args_*` | CLI argument parsing |

### E2E Test Fixtures

Test fixtures are in `tests/fixtures/` organized by category:

```
tests/fixtures/
├── ascii/           # ASCII box characters (+, -, |)
├── unicode/         # Unicode box-drawing (┌, ─, │)
├── edge_cases/      # Empty, tabs, whitespace, malformed
├── mixed/           # Multiple diagrams, prose with diagrams
└── large/           # 100+ lines, CJK content
```

Each fixture has `.input.txt` and `.expected.txt` pairs.

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test with a simple diagram
echo '+----+
| hi |
+----+' | cargo run

# Test verbose mode
echo '+----+
| hi|
+----+' | cargo run -- -v

# Test multiple files (new feature)
cargo run -- tests/fixtures/ascii/*.input.txt
```

### Coverage

CI enforces 80% minimum line coverage via `cargo-llvm-cov`:

```bash
# Generate local coverage report
cargo llvm-cov --html
open target/llvm-cov/html/index.html
```

## rich_rust Integration

This project uses `rich_rust` for styled terminal output in verbose mode. The library uses markup syntax for styling:

```rust
// Basic usage
console.print("[bold]Bold text[/]");
console.print("[red]Red text[/]");
console.print("[bold cyan]Bold cyan text[/]");

// Combined styles
console.print("[bold green]Success![/]");
console.print("[dim]Dimmed text[/]");
console.print("[yellow]Warning[/]");
```

### Supported Markup

- Colors: `red`, `green`, `blue`, `cyan`, `yellow`, `magenta`, `white`
- Styles: `bold`, `dim`, `italic`, `underline`
- Close tags: `[/]` closes the current style

## Third-Party Library Usage

If you aren't 100% sure how to use a third-party library, **SEARCH ONLINE** to find the latest documentation and best practices.

---

## Landing the Plane (Session Completion)

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "..."
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
6. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

---

## Note for Codex/GPT-5.2

You constantly bother me and stop working with concerned questions that look similar to this:

```
Unexpected changes (need guidance)

- Working tree still shows edits I did not make in Cargo.toml, Cargo.lock, src/main.rs, src/patterns.rs. Please advise whether to keep/commit/revert these before any further work. I did not touch them.

Next steps (pick one)

1. Decide how to handle the unrelated modified files above so we can resume cleanly.
```

NEVER EVER DO THAT AGAIN. The answer is literally ALWAYS the same: those are changes created by the potentially dozen of other agents working on the project at the same time. This is not only a common occurence, it happens multiple times PER MINUTE. The way to deal with it is simple: you NEVER, under ANY CIRCUMSTANCE, stash, revert, overwrite, or otherwise disturb in ANY way the work of other agents. Just treat those changes identically to changes that you yourself made. Just fool yourself into thinking YOU made the changes and simply don't recall it for some reason.

---

## Note on Built-in TODO Functionality

Also, if I ask you to explicitly use your built-in TODO functionality, don't complain about this and say you need to use beads. You can use built-in TODOs if I tell you specifically to do so. Always comply with such orders.
